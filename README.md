# Accessibility Demo
The purpose of this demo is to accompany the "Accessibility Matters: Building Accessible Web Interfaces From the Start" presentation that I gave at Code on the Beach 2019. This example shows that while a web page can look the same visually, whether or not it's accessible is determined by how the code is implemented.

## Topic Abstract
With the ever growing dependency on technology, there is no denying that web accessibility matters. So why do we continue to treat it as an afterthought? Instead of adding accessibility at the end, let's challenge ourselves to code with accessibility in mind from square one. In this session, we will deepen our understanding of what exactly web accessibility means and go over what we as developers can do to code with accessibility in mind. We will review common pitfalls, best practices, and useful techniques for building an accessible web interface from the start.
